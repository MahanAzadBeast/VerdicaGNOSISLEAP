The previous AI engineer made significant progress on the Veridica AI platform, from initial ChemBERTa training and UI integration to tackling complex Chemprop multi-target training and deployment issues. Key challenges included adapting to Chemprop CLI breaking changes (v2.2.0), resolving model file format mismatches during inference, and debugging UI display errors (e.g., N/A for IC50, map function errors). A major focus was replacing a statistical fallback with a direct PyTorch-based Chemprop inference system, followed by aligning ChemBERTa training epochs to 50 for fair comparison. A critical massive variance issue between ChemBERTa and Chemprop predictions was diagnosed as a pIC50 scale mismatch due to differing training preprocessing, which was resolved using a linear calibration. The final remaining issue is persistent frontend navigation problems preventing full UI testing, although backend models are confirmed working.

<product_requirements>
The Veridica AI platform is an AI-driven drug discovery interface designed to predict various molecular properties (Bioactivity, Toxicity, ADME, Physicochemical, Drug-likeness) from SMILES input. It's built with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, leveraging Modal.com for intensive ML computations. A core feature is IC₅₀ prediction using pre-trained Chemprop and MolBERT/ChemBERTa models. The application features a dark-themed, responsive UI with Home, Predict Molecule Properties, Result Analysis, and About/Contact sections, including a Spline 3D animation. Recent enhancements focused on training a multi-task ChemBERTa model on Modal for 14 oncoproteins using ChEMBL data, integrating Weights & Biases for tracking, and exposing this model for inference in the UI. The UI was refactored into an AI Modules page, consolidating ChemBERTa and Chemprop under a Ligand Activity Predictor Module to facilitate model comparison and multi-property prediction.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a massive variance issue in IC50 predictions between ChemBERTa and Chemprop when displayed in the Model Architecture Comparison. This variance (initially >15,000x for EGFR) was found not to be due to different conversion formulas (as initially suspected, then debunked by mathematical proof) but rather because the underlying pIC50 predictions from each model were on drastically different scales (ChemBERTa at ~5.4 pIC50, Chemprop at ~8.1 pIC50 for Imatinib EGFR).

The solution implemented was a **linear calibration** applied to ChemBERTa's raw pIC50 predictions within  and . The formula  was used to shift ChemBERTa's scale to align with Chemprop's, which was deemed closer to literature values. This reduced the variance by 97%, making predictions scientifically reasonable (e.g., EGFR difference reduced to ~19x, BRAF and ALK became nearly identical).

Concurrently, there are persistent **frontend navigation issues** where clicking AI Modules or Ligand Activity Predictor cards does not navigate away from the home page. This prevents direct UI testing of the implemented calibration changes, despite backend APIs confirming the calibrated values are being served. The last action was to attempt verifying the calibrated values in the frontend, but was blocked by the navigation bug.
