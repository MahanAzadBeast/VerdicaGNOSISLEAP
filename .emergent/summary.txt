The previous AI engineer developed the Veridica AI platform, evolving it from initial ChemBERTa training and UI integration to a robust multi-model prediction system. Significant effort was spent resolving critical issues like Chemprop CLI version changes, model file format mismatches, and a massive variance in ChemBERTa/Chemprop predictions due to pIC50 scale differences, fixed via linear calibration. The work then pivoted to expanding the prediction models' training data by integrating multiple bioactivity sources and setting up a comprehensive multi-stage training pipeline for ChemBERTa and Chemprop. This pipeline faced initial deployment and data integrity issues (e.g.,  due to DataFrame column mismatch) which were debugged and fixed. Most recently, the strategic focus shifted towards AI-driven molecular generation, leading to the integration of PropMolFlow. The latest task involves expanding the dataset further with PubChem BioAssay to support the training of both prediction and generation models, recognizing the significant data requirements for robust generative AI.

<product_requirements>
The Veridica AI platform is an AI-driven drug discovery interface predicting molecular properties (Bioactivity, Toxicity, ADME, Physicochemical, Drug-likeness) from SMILES. It uses a React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB, and Modal.com for ML. Core features include IC₅₀ prediction via Chemprop and ChemBERTa models. The UI is dark-themed and responsive, with sections for Home, Predict Molecule Properties, Result Analysis, and About/Contact. Recent work focused on multi-task ChemBERTa training for 14 oncoproteins using ChEMBL data, integrated with Weights & Biases, and exposed via a refactored AI Modules page, unifying ChemBERTa and Chemprop under a Ligand Activity Predictor Module for comparison. The current user request is to expand the prediction models' databases to include more oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, and metastasis suppressors (23 total targets), incorporating additional data sources like PubChem BioAssay, BindingDB, and DTC, ensuring standardized datasets (median IC50 for duplicates, discard >100-fold difference, high-confidence experimental assays only). The long-term vision is to expand into AI molecule/drug generation using PropMolFlow.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on addressing two primary objectives: first, resolving a massive variance issue in IC50 predictions between ChemBERTa and Chemprop, which was successfully mitigated by applying a linear calibration to ChemBERTa's pIC50 predictions (). This significantly reduced prediction discrepancies. Second, the user requested a major expansion of the training databases for both prediction models (ChemBERTa and Chemprop) to include more targets (23, comprising oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, and metastasis suppressors) and additional data sources (PubChem, BindingDB, DTC).

This led to the implementation of a new multi-source data extraction and training pipeline (, , ), and corresponding backend integration (). During this integration, a critical issue with duplicate FastAPI app declarations in  causing 404 errors for new endpoints was diagnosed and fixed.

The pipeline was launched, but encountered  during extraction due to DataFrame column mismatches. This was addressed by creating a  and a new  to ensure robust, background execution of the extraction and subsequent training. This fixed pipeline is currently running.

In parallel, a strategic shift towards AI molecule generation was initiated, with the user deciding to integrate **PropMolFlow**. The AI engineer successfully implemented the basic PropMolFlow architecture () and integrated its generation capabilities into the backend API (), creating new endpoints and updating the health status. This integration has been tested and confirmed to be fully functional from the backend.

The user then raised concerns about the sufficiency of the current 25K dataset for PropMolFlow training and its ability to generate chemically sound molecules. The AI engineer provided a detailed assessment, highlighting 25K as borderline and chemical validity as a major concern. A comprehensive strategy was proposed to expand the dataset to 174K+ records from 15 sources (including PubChem BioAssay, IUPHAR, GDSC, Patent Mining) and to implement robust chemical validity constraints. The immediate next step decided upon was to incorporate PubChem BioAssay into the existing data extraction pipeline to boost the dataset size from 25K to 75K+ for existing models, and prepare for PropMolFlow training. The work is currently focused on implementing this PubChem BioAssay enhancement ().
