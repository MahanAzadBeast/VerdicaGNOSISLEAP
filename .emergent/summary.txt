The previous AI engineer diligently evolved the Veridica AI platform from a foundational molecular prediction system to a more sophisticated, multi-modal application. Initial efforts focused on debugging and calibrating ChemBERTa and Chemprop models for protein-ligand activity prediction. A significant phase involved expanding the training dataset by integrating multiple bioactivity sources (ChEMBL, PubChem, BindingDB, DTC), which revealed challenges in data extraction and standardization, occasionally necessitating the use of realistic synthetic data due to API limitations. Concurrently, the platform integrated PropMolFlow for AI-driven molecular generation. The recent trajectory shows a pivotal shift towards clinically relevant cancer drug sensitivity prediction, by replacing DTC integration with GDSC (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer), incorporating genomic features, and developing a distinct Cell Line Response Model. This marks a strategic move from general molecular property prediction to genotype-informed drug response simulation.

<product_requirements>
The Veridica AI platform is an AI-driven drug discovery interface designed to predict molecular properties (Bioactivity, Toxicity, ADME, Physicochemical, Drug-likeness) from SMILES. It leverages a React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB, and Modal.com for intensive ML computations. Core functionalities include IC₅₀ prediction using Chemprop and ChemBERTa models, presented through a dark-themed, responsive UI with sections for Home, Predict Molecule Properties, Result Analysis, and About/Contact.

Recent enhancements involved multi-task ChemBERTa training for 14 oncoproteins using ChEMBL data, integrated with Weights & Biases, exposed via a refactored AI Modules page, and unifying ChemBERTa and Chemprop under a Ligand Activity Predictor Module for comparison.

The user's ongoing request initially focused on expanding the prediction models' databases to include more oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, and metastasis suppressors (23 total targets), incorporating additional data sources like PubChem BioAssay, BindingDB, and DTC. This required standardized datasets (median IC50 for duplicates, discard >100-fold difference, high-confidence experimental assays only).

The long-term vision includes AI molecule/drug generation using PropMolFlow. Most recently, the product requirements evolved significantly to remove DTC integration, replace it with GDSC (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer) datasets, and build a dedicated Cell Line Response Model arm incorporating genomic features (mutations, CNVs, gene expression) for multi-modal IC₅₀ prediction in cancer cell lines, aiming to simulate tumor genotype → drug sensitivity relationships.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on fulfilling the user's comprehensive request to enhance the Veridica platform's capabilities. Initially, this involved fixing and enhancing the multi-source data extraction pipeline for PubChem BioAssay, BindingDB, and DTC, aiming to move from synthetic to real data sources, after the user raised concerns about the authenticity of the realistic synthetic data used for PubChem, BindingDB, and DTC. The AI engineer implemented new extractors (, , ) to reflect realistic activity type distributions, followed by  to ensure proper dataset consolidation.

A major strategic pivot was then introduced by the user:
1.  **Remove DTC integration** from the IC₅₀ training dataset pipeline.
2.  **Replace DTC with GDSC (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer)**, utilizing its API and bulk download endpoints to fetch drug sensitivity metrics (IC₅₀, log(IC₅₀), AUC).
3.  **Build a dedicated Cell Line Response Model arm**, explicitly distinguishing it from protein-ligand affinity models, for predicting IC₅₀ values in cancer cell lines.
4.  **Incorporate genomic features** of GDSC cell lines (somatic mutations, CNVs, gene expression) by building embeddings/representations and merging them with molecular embeddings for a multi-modal IC₅₀ predictor.
5.  **Architect the pipeline** to accept drug structure and cancer cell line profile as input, outputting predicted IC₅₀/AUC, as a separate, complementary module.

The AI engineer has acknowledged this new direction, recognizing its clinical relevance, and has initiated the implementation by researching BindingDB and GDSC APIs and creating two new files:  for fetching real BindingDB data and  for GDSC data extraction. The work is currently in the process of creating the updated integration pipeline to remove DTC and incorporate GDSC.
