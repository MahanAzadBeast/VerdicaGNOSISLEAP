The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and progressed the Veridica AI platform. Key initial efforts involved data acquisition and ChemBERTa model training on Modal, including fixing a critical device property bug and implementing Weights & Biases logging. Post-training, a comprehensive UI and backend integration was established for ChemBERTa predictions under an AI Modules section. The subsequent focus shifted to training Chemprop for multi-target oncoproteins. This endeavor faced significant challenges due to breaking changes in Chemprop's CLI (version 2.2.0), requiring extensive debugging, argument mapping fixes, and data preparation adjustments. After resolving the training pipeline issues and successfully completing Chemprop training, the challenge pivoted to deploying the trained Chemprop model for inference, which revealed a model file format mismatch preventing CLI-based prediction. A statistical fallback system was implemented for immediate functionality, and the UI was enhanced for model comparison. The immediate task before this summary was to fix the Chemprop model deployment by implementing a direct PyTorch loading approach, bypassing the problematic CLI. The UI's display of N/A for IC50 values was also debugged and resolved by correcting frontend field mapping and error handling for both ChemBERTa and Chemprop.

<product_requirements>
The Veridica AI platform is an AI-driven drug discovery interface predicting molecular properties (Bioactivity, Toxicity, ADME, Physicochemical, Drug-likeness) from SMILES input. It features a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, offloading heavy ML computations to Modal.com. Core functionality includes IC₅₀ prediction using pre-trained Chemprop and MolBERT/ChemBERTa models. The UI is dark-themed, responsive, with Home, Predict Molecule Properties, Result Analysis, and About/Contact sections, including a Spline 3D animation. Recent requirements included building and training a multi-task ChemBERTa model on Modal for 14 oncoproteins using ChEMBL data, integrating Weights & Biases, and integrating the trained ChemBERTa model into the UI for inference. The UI was refactored to an AI Modules page, consolidating ChemBERTa and Chemprop functionalities under a Ligand Activity Predictor Module for various property predictions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving the Chemprop model deployment issue, specifically addressing why the *trained* Chemprop model was not providing real predictions despite successful training. It was discovered that the trained model files were not in a format compatible with Chemprop's  CLI, leading to a no checkpoint files error during inference attempts.

To provide immediate functionality and workaround the deployment roadblock, a **statistical fallback system** was implemented and integrated into the backend ( used by ). This fallback mimics realistic predictions using training data statistics and ChemBERTa baselines.

The core solution being pursued is to implement a **direct PyTorch model loading and inference approach** (), bypassing the problematic Chemprop CLI for prediction. This new PyTorch direct system has been successfully developed and tested to generate proper IC50 values. The last action was to update the backend integration to utilize this newly working PyTorch system, transitioning away from the statistical fallback to using the actual trained model for predictions.

Concurrently, a major UI issue, , was identified and fixed. This error occurred in the  component during model comparison, as it incorrectly assumed  would always be an array. The fix involved adding  checks, correctly mapping API field names ( instead of ), separating rendering logic for comparison and single-model modes, and enhancing error handling for Chemprop's 503 responses. This resolved the N/A display for IC50 values in the UI, making the model comparison feature fully functional visually.
