The previous AI engineer successfully launched the Veridica AI platform MVP. Initial efforts focused on migrating MolBERT training to Modal.com GPUs for performance, but this custom training yielded poor R² scores. Consequently, the strategy pivoted to fine-tuning a pre-trained MolBERT model from BenevolentAI. The engineer managed to download and extract the pre-trained weights and repository. Initial attempts to integrate the fine-tuner () faced significant PyTorch Lightning and HuggingFace Transformers compatibility issues, prompting a shift to a new, simpler approach (). The current state involves examining this simplified fine-tuner and confirming the availability and structure of the pre-trained model. The immediate work left off with the successful import of the  module, indicating readiness for further debugging and implementation of the fine-tuning process.

<product_requirements>
The Veridica AI platform is designed as an AI-driven drug discovery interface, facilitating molecular property predictions (Bioactivity, Toxicity, ADME, Physicochemical, Drug-likeness) from SMILES input. It's built with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. The core functionality involves leveraging pre-trained Chemprop and MolBERT/ChemBERTa models for IC₅₀ prediction, trained on ChEMBL/BindingDB, with future plans for confidence scoring. The UI features a dark-themed, responsive design with Home, Predict Molecule Properties, Result Analysis (with visualizations/export), and About/Contact tabs. The homepage includes a Spline 3D animation banner with overlay text and a branded logo. The ongoing challenge has been ensuring reliable AI model function, managing long-running training, and clear result presentation. Recent work included refining the  component for unit correction (IC₅₀ to µM) and consolidating predictions. Crucially, MolBERT training was migrated to Modal.com GPUs for performance. The latest product directive is to transition from training MolBERT from scratch to fine-tuning a pre-trained MolBERT model from BenevolentAI.

<current_work>
The most immediate work centered on migrating MolBERT training to Modal.com's A100 GPUs, establishing the  directory and associated backend API endpoints. Although deployment and training runs were successful, the custom MolBERT training yielded poor R² scores, leading to a strategic pivot.

The current focus is on fine-tuning a pre-trained MolBERT model from BenevolentAI. The AI engineer successfully cloned the official MolBERT repository to  and downloaded  to , extracting it to  which contains  (pretrained weights) and .

Initial fine-tuning attempts via  encountered severe compatibility issues with PyTorch Lightning and HuggingFace Transformers, necessitating direct modifications within the cloned  repository (e.g., , ). Due to persistent errors, a new, simplified approach was adopted, leading to the creation of  and its test script . The  contains a  function, a basic MolBERT model class, and an async  function. The  of the pretrained model was confirmed to have . The trajectory concludes with the successful import of  and confirmation of 'cpu' as the device, indicating readiness to proceed with testing and debugging this simplified fine-tuning setup.
