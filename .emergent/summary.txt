The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the Veridica AI platform from a general molecular prediction system to a multi-modal application, now focusing on cancer drug sensitivity. Initial efforts included debugging ChemBERTa/Chemprop for protein-ligand prediction and expanding datasets from ChEMBL, PubChem, BindingDB, and DTC. A key strategic pivot, driven by user requests, was the removal of DTC integration and its replacement with GDSC (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer) data, coupled with the development of a distinct Cell Line Response Model incorporating genomic features. The engineer successfully integrated new data extractors and established a dual-track architecture for protein-ligand and cell-line models, including backend API endpoints and frontend UI for the new cell line model. Despite initial claims of successful training completion, the Cell Line Response Model exhibited a poor negative R² score, leading to a user-mandated architectural overhaul to use ChemBERTa embeddings for molecular encoding and maximize GDSC data. The current work is focused on implementing this enhanced architecture and relaunching training.

<product_requirements>
The Veridica AI platform is an AI-driven drug discovery interface predicting molecular properties from SMILES using React, FastAPI, MongoDB, and Modal. Core functionality includes IC₅₀ prediction via Chemprop and ChemBERTa models. Recent work extended multi-task ChemBERTa for oncoproteins using ChEMBL, exposed via an AI Modules page. The user's goal evolved to expand prediction models for 23 targets (oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, metastasis suppressors) using PubChem BioAssay, BindingDB, and initially DTC, requiring standardized data. The long-term vision includes AI molecule generation via PropMolFlow. Most recently, the product requirements shifted significantly: remove DTC, replace with GDSC (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer) datasets, and build a dedicated Cell Line Response Model incorporating genomic features (mutations, CNVs, gene expression) for multi-modal IC₅₀ prediction in cancer cell lines, simulating tumor genotype → drug sensitivity relationships. The latest update mandates using ChemBERTa embeddings for the molecular encoder in this Cell Line Model and maximizing GDSC dataset size due to poor initial model performance.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into the Cell Line Response Model development. Initially, the focus was on replacing synthetic data for PubChem BioAssay, BindingDB, and DTC with real API integrations. The user then introduced a major pivot: remove DTC, integrate GDSC data, and build a dedicated Cell Line Response Model for cancer cell lines incorporating genomic features.

The AI engineer successfully implemented the initial version of this Cell Line Response Model, including new extractors for real BindingDB and GDSC data, an updated database integration pipeline that removes DTC, the PyTorch model architecture (), and a FastAPI backend integration (), along with a full frontend UI (). Backend API endpoints for the Cell Line Model were integrated and tested with 91.7% success, and a demo script showcased its capabilities.

However, subsequent training attempts for this Cell Line Model encountered issues: a  (seaborn), a  (numpy dtype), and Modal image build failures. Although a local training run  eventually completed and saved model artifacts, the reported  was a poor -0.82. The trained model also failed to load correctly into the backend, falling back to simulation, indicating a persistent pickle loading issue for custom classes.

Recognizing the unsatisfactory performance, the user then explicitly requested a significant architectural change for the Cell Line Response Model: it must now use **ChemBERTa embeddings** for the molecular encoder, maximize the GDSC dataset, and finetune the pretrained ChemBERTa model.

The current work immediately before this summary is the initiation of this new architectural implementation. The AI engineer has created  to maximize GDSC data and  for the new ChemBERTa-based architecture, and has just launched the comprehensive GDSC data extraction, followed by the ChemBERTa training.
