The previous AI engineer initially focused on data acquisition and preprocessing for a multi-task ChemBERTa model on Modal, pivoting from failed ChEMBL database downloads to a successful API-based extraction for 14 oncoproteins. After addressing the user's explicit request to fix training issues, the engineer successfully resolved a critical device property bug in ChemBERTa training and updated Chemprop for its new CLI. Crucially, a focused ChemBERTa training run on 10 non-sparse targets completed successfully, with R² scores provided directly, resolving a prior W&B logging visibility issue. Subsequently, the engineer implemented a comprehensive UI and backend integration for ChemBERTa predictions under a new AI Modules section. The current work halted while attempting to train Chemprop for multi-target oncoproteins, encountering a new CLI compatibility issue with Chemprop version 2.2.0.

<product_requirements>
The Veridica AI platform is an AI-driven drug discovery interface designed to predict molecular properties (Bioactivity, Toxicity, ADME, Physicochemical, Drug-likeness) from SMILES input. It operates with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Core functionality includes IC₅₀ prediction using pre-trained Chemprop and MolBERT/ChemBERTa models, with all heavy AI computations offloaded to Modal.com. The UI features a dark-themed, responsive design with Home, Predict Molecule Properties, Result Analysis, and About/Contact sections, including a Spline 3D animation.

A primary recent requirement was building and training a multi-task ChemBERTa model on Modal for key oncoproteins (EGFR, HER2, BRAF, MET, MDM2, STAT3, RRM2, β-catenin, MYC, PI3KCA, CDK4, CDK6, ALK, VEGFR2) using ChEMBL data. This encompassed data acquisition, preprocessing, multi-task training setup, and an inference script. The latest explicit requests included integrating Weights & Biases (W&B) for both ChemBERTa and Chemprop training, logging granular metrics, and then integrating the trained ChemBERTa model into the UI for inference on input SMILES, displaying predicted IC₅₀ for each oncoprotein. Most recently, the UI was refactored to an AI Modules page, consolidating ChemBERTa and planned Chemprop functionalities under a Ligand Activity Predictor Module for various property predictions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the focus was on **training Chemprop on the multi-target oncoproteins**, mirroring the successful ChemBERTa training. This involved creating  and a launcher script .

The attempt to launch the Chemprop training via Modal failed with a  error, indicating a problem with the command being executed. Upon investigation, the AI engineer identified that the newer version of Chemprop (version 2.2.0) has a revised Command Line Interface (CLI), specifically noting that the  module no longer exists. A simple test script  was created to diagnose this.

The current state is that the Chemprop training pipeline is broken due to a breaking change in the Chemprop library's CLI, preventing the training from even starting on Modal. This is the immediate roadblock that needs to be resolved. All previous work, including ChemBERTa training, its UI integration, and the overall AI Modules UI structure, is functional.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate the new Chemprop 2.2.0 CLI/API and adapt  to correctly launch the multi-task training.
