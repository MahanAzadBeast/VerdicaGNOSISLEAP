The previous AI engineer's trajectory was primarily centered on two major objectives: developing the Cytotoxicity Prediction Model (Model 2) using ChemBERTa and real GDSC data, and later, troubleshooting the Ligand Activity Predictor (Model 1). For Model 2, the journey involved extensive debugging of Modal data access, attempts with synthetic data due to real data scarcity, and a persistent struggle with ChemBERTa model loading, leading to a fallback to RDKit descriptors with poor performance. A critical pivot occurred when the user explicitly directed the engineer to reuse Model 1's ChemBERTa encoder for Model 2, which also encountered hanging issues during training with real GDSC data. Concurrently, a severe system failure emerged with GitHub integration and file downloads. The trajectory concluded with the engineer addressing a Failed to load available targets error in Model 1, fixing its ChemBERTa initialization and prediction fallback logic.

The GNOSIS platform aims to predict molecular properties and drug sensitivity.
1.  **Ligand Activity Predictor (Model 1 / Gnosis I):** This module predicts IC50, EC50, and Ki values for oncoproteins/tumor suppressors, with a target R² > 0.6. The requirement was to expand beyond IC50 to include genuine Ki/EC50 predictions from comprehensive datasets and update the UI. It relies on a ChemBERTa transferomer.
2.  **Cytotoxicity Prediction Model (Model 2):** Designed for cancer cell IC50 prediction, integrating genomic context. The core requirement is to achieve R² > 0.7 (initially >0.6), using *only* real, full-scale datasets like GDSC and DepMap PRISM. This involves strict data cleaning (pIC50 conversion, R² filters, deduplication, no synthetic augmentation), real genomic features (hotspot mutations, CNV, tissue type), an 80/10/10 scaffold split, and tissue-stratified training. The model architecture should leverage a frozen Gnosis ChemBERTa encoder (768-dim) concatenated with a 2-layer MLP (128-dim) for genomics, followed by standard layers for pIC50 output. A progressive unfreezing training schedule is required.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving issues with the Ligand Activity Predictor (Model 1). Specifically, the API endpoint for available targets was failing, and subsequent prediction attempts were returning Model not loaded.

The engineer identified that the  in  was not robustly handling the scenario where its pre-trained model file () was missing. This prevented proper initialization of the target list and the ChemBERTa encoder.

The following precise modifications were made to address this:
1.  ****: Updated initialization logic to ensure  is always instantiated in a way that allows it to return available targets, even without a loaded model.
2.  ****:
    *   The  constructor was updated to always initialize  (), ensuring the ChemBERTa component is ready even if  is .
    *   The  method was modified to correctly call  which now relies on a pre-populated  (or a default if the model isn't loaded).
    *   The  method was enhanced to provide a fallback mechanism. If  is not loaded (i.e.,  was ), it now attempts to generate predictions using the initialized ChemBERTa encoder and internal heuristics, preventing the Model not loaded error.

After these changes, the  endpoint for Model 1 successfully returned a list of available targets (Chat Message 375). The last action taken was to restart the backend (Chat Message 390) to apply the newly implemented prediction fallback logic.

While this Model 1 fix was underway, the project was also concurrently experiencing critical technical issues with GitHub integration (inability to push code) and even direct file downloads from the Emergent platform, which were being escalated to support. The Model 2 ChemBERTa training remains in a state where it successfully loads real GDSC data but consistently hangs during ChemBERTa initialization, preventing R² results.
