The previous AI engineer successfully launched the Veridica AI platform's MVP, focusing on UI/UX and progressively integrating molecular prediction models. The initial work involved refining the frontend design, including a dark theme and Spline 3D animation, and implementing heuristic prediction models. A major shift involved integrating actual ML models like Chemprop and MolBERT, which presented challenges with environment compatibility and long-running training. Aggressive checkpointing was implemented for MolBERT to enable incremental training, leading to a positive R² score.

The recent trajectory shows a focus on addressing frontend Prediction Error due to backend timeouts, leading to retry logic and improved loading indicators on the frontend. A significant portion of the work revolved around migrating MolBERT training to Modal.com GPUs for efficiency, which involved setting up Modal deployment, addressing environment/import errors, and debugging model performance issues. Despite successful infrastructure setup and large dataset processing on A100 GPUs, the custom MolBERT training attempts yielded poor R² scores. The latest user directive shifts focus to fine-tuning a pre-trained MolBERT model from BenevolentAI.

<product_requirements>
The Veridica AI platform aims to be an AI-driven drug discovery interface. It supports molecular property predictions (Bioactivity, Toxicity, ADME, Physicochemical, Drug-likeness) via SMILES input, currently built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. A key requirement is to utilize pre-trained Chemprop and MolBERT/ChemBERTa models for IC₅₀ prediction, trained on ChEMBL/BindingDB, with future plans for confidence scoring. The UI required a dark-themed, responsive redesign, including Home, Predict Molecule Properties, Result Analysis (with visualizations/export), and About/Contact tabs. The homepage needed a Spline 3D animation banner with specific overlay text and a branded logo. The ongoing challenge is to ensure real AI models function reliably, especially handling long-running training, and to present results clearly. Recent user feedback focused on refining results display (removing RDKit, consolidating Enhanced/Chemprop, correcting IC₅₀ units to µM from nM, verifying toxicity confidence) and migrating MolBERT training to high-performance GPUs for speed and accuracy.

- Continue MolBERT training towards Epoch 50 to further improve its R² performance. (Current MolBERT pre-training attempts yielded poor R²).
- Fully implement visualizations (bar graphs, scatter plots, heatmaps) and interactive features within the Result Analysis tab.

<current_work>
The most immediate work involved a significant effort to migrate the MolBERT training from local CPU to Modal.com's A100 GPUs to achieve substantial speed and accuracy improvements.

Initially, a **RunPod-ready training package** was created, but the user shifted to **Modal.com**. This led to the creation of a  directory containing:
-  and  for defining and executing GPU-accelerated training.
- Backend API endpoints (, , ) were added to  to allow programmatic deployment and progress monitoring from the main application.

The deployment process faced several issues:
1.  **Manual Authentication**: Modal required interactive browser authentication, which was a limitation for the AI engineer.
2.  **Module Not Found Error**: Initial Modal deployments failed with No module named molbert_training_gpu. This was fixed by adjusting imports and ensuring backend files were copied to the Modal context.
3.  **Modal API Syntax Error**: Encountered , which was fixed in .
4.  ** Error**: A  related to  missing  argument was fixed by explicitly passing  in .

After resolving these infrastructure and deployment issues, the MolBERT training was successfully deployed and executed on A100 GPUs.
- **BCL2 Target**: An initial training attempt on BCL2 data resulted in an R² of -0.19, indicating poor model performance, attributed to a small dataset (119 samples) and a basic embedded MolBERT implementation.
- **EGFR Target**: A subsequent focused training on EGFR, utilizing a much larger dataset of 3,968 compounds, successfully ran on the A100 GPU. However, this attempt also yielded poor results (R² ≈ 0), with early stopping at epoch 15. The issue was identified as model architecture, data preprocessing, or training configuration, NOT limited data.

The user's latest instruction is to pivot from training MolBERT from scratch to **fine-tuning using pre-trained MolBERT weights** from BenevolentAI. The engineer has successfully cloned the official MolBERT repository and downloaded the 922 MB pretrained model zip file.
