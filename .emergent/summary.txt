The previous AI engineer successfully launched the Veridica AI platform MVP, transitioning from heuristic to ML models like Chemprop and MolBERT. Key work involved addressing frontend Prediction Error timeouts with retry logic and migrating MolBERT training to Modal.com GPUs. Despite infrastructure setup for Modal, custom MolBERT training attempts yielded poor R² scores, leading to a pivot to fine-tuning a pre-trained MolBERT model from BenevolentAI. The current focus is on setting up this fine-tuning environment. The engineer successfully downloaded the MolBERT repository and pretrained weights, extracted them, and began integrating them. However, multiple compatibility issues with PyTorch Lightning and HuggingFace Transformers libraries have arisen during the initial attempts to implement the fine-tuner, necessitating a shift towards a simpler, more direct fine-tuning approach to bypass version conflicts.

<product_requirements>
The Veridica AI platform aims to be an AI-driven drug discovery interface, enabling molecular property predictions (Bioactivity, Toxicity, ADME, Physicochemical, Drug-likeness) via SMILES input. The application is built with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. A core requirement is to leverage pre-trained Chemprop and MolBERT/ChemBERTa models for IC₅₀ prediction, trained on ChEMBL/BindingDB, with future plans for confidence scoring. The UI needed a dark-themed, responsive redesign with Home, Predict Molecule Properties, Result Analysis (with visualizations/export), and About/Contact tabs. The homepage required a Spline 3D animation banner with specific overlay text and a branded logo. The ongoing challenge is ensuring reliable function of AI models, especially handling long-running training, and clear result presentation. Recent refinements included cleaning up the  component (removing RDKit, consolidating Enhanced/Chemprop predictions, correcting IC₅₀ units to µM, verifying toxicity confidence display) and migrating MolBERT training to high-performance GPUs (Modal.com) for improved speed and accuracy. The most recent directive is to pivot from training MolBERT from scratch to fine-tuning a pre-trained MolBERT model from BenevolentAI.

<current_work>
The most immediate work involved a significant effort to migrate the MolBERT training from local CPU to Modal.com's A100 GPUs to achieve substantial speed and accuracy improvements. This led to the creation and debugging of the  directory and associated backend API endpoints in . Despite successfully deploying and running training jobs on A100 GPUs for targets like BCL2 and EGFR, the results were poor (low R²), indicating issues with the custom MolBERT implementation or training configuration.

The user's latest instruction shifted the focus from training MolBERT from scratch to fine-tuning using pre-trained MolBERT weights from BenevolentAI. The AI engineer has successfully cloned the official MolBERT repository () and downloaded the  file to . The zip file has been successfully extracted to , containing  (the pretrained weights) and .

The current work is focused on integrating these pre-trained weights for fine-tuning. An initial attempt involved creating  and adding  as a dependency. However, multiple compatibility issues were encountered with PyTorch Lightning (e.g.,  removal) and HuggingFace Transformers ( module path, ,  not found). The engineer attempted to fix these by modifying files within the cloned  repository (specifically  and ). Due to persistent compatibility errors, the strategy has shifted to creating a new, simpler fine-tuning implementation () to bypass these version conflicts, along with its test script (). The trajectory concludes just after these new files have been created.
