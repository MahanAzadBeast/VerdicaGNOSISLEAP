The previous AI engineer successfully launched the Veridica AI platform's MVP, focusing on a robust UI/UX and integrating initial molecular prediction models. A significant portion of the work involved an iterative UI redesign, including implementing a dark theme, new navigation tabs, and extensive refinement of a Spline 3D animation on the homepage. Key challenges included precisely positioning the Spline animation, fixing cropping issues, and dynamically placing feature boxes. Concurrently, the engineer attempted to integrate *real* Chemprop/ChemBERTa models with ChEMBL data for IC₅₀ prediction, but faced persistent technical blockers related to slow data downloads and model initialization timeouts. This led to a fallback to sophisticated heuristic models, ensuring the platform remained functional. The work concluded with the engineer actively debugging a prediction error, identifying and temporarily bypassing the blocking real model initialization to restore service, and then attempting to fetch specific ChEMBL data for actual model training.

<product_requirements>
The Veridica AI platform aims to be an AI-driven drug discovery interface, supporting molecular property predictions (Bioactivity, Toxicity, ADME, Physicochemical, Drug-likeness) via SMILES input. The MVP uses React/FastAPI/MongoDB. A key shift was requiring *actual* pre-trained Chemprop and MolBERT/ChemBERTa models for IC₅₀ prediction, trained on ChEMBL/BindingDB, with future confidence scoring. The UI needed a dark-themed, responsive redesign, incorporating Home, Predict Molecule Properties, Result Analysis (new, with visualizations/export), and About/Contact tabs. The homepage required a Spline 3D animation banner, meticulously positioned and un-cropped, with a Start Discovery AI title overlay, and a new branded logo replacing text. The immediate problem is ensuring real AI models function while maintaining the refined UI.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently focused on resolving a Failed to Get Predictions error reported by the user. This error was traced to a 500 Internal Server Error in the backend, primarily caused by the ChEMBL data download process blocking the application's startup and subsequent requests.

To mitigate this, the engineer temporarily disabled the real ML model initialization and ChEMBL data downloads in  and . This ensures the application consistently falls back to its robust heuristic-based prediction models, thereby restoring full functionality for the  endpoint.

Following the fix, the prediction form on the frontend () was confirmed to be working, allowing users to input SMILES and select prediction types.

The immediate next step involved attempting to fetch real EGFR IC50 data using a specific ChEMBL API endpoint provided by the user. The engineer successfully queried the API but discovered the initial  () corresponded to Delta opioid receptor instead of EGFR, prompting the need to identify the correct ChEMBL ID for the Epidermal growth factor receptor.
