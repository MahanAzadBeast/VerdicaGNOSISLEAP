The previous AI engineer initiated work on Gnosis II (Cytotoxicity Model) and Gnosis I (Ligand Activity Predictor), facing challenges with ChemBERTa integration and data access. A critical pivot shifted focus to stabilizing Gnosis I, involving UI and backend refinements, including removing problematic Ki predictions and ensuring accurate EC50 filtering. A robust Model Registry with S3 integration was also established. The core recent task involved implementing an Applicability Domain (AD) layer for Gnosis I. This complex feature, requiring multi-view scoring and conformal prediction, was built incrementally, overcoming initial fingerprint conversion errors and file conflicts. Performance issues led to a significant optimization phase, resulting in a High-Performance AD Layer that dramatically improved inference latency to sub-5s. Subsequently, efforts focused on resolving frontend/backend data mismatches and display inconsistencies related to target loading and categorization. The latest work successfully refined backend target categorization and corrected frontend data consumption, bringing the application closer to a stable, reliable state.

<product_requirements>
The GNOSIS platform aims to predict molecular properties and drug sensitivity.
1.  **Ligand Activity Predictor (Gnosis I / Model 1):** Predicts IC50/EC50 for oncoproteins/tumor suppressors (R² > 0.6). It must only provide data-backed predictions, accurately display available targets in the UI, and remove invalid Ki predictions. EC50 predictions must be dynamically filtered based on sufficient training data (>= 25 samples). A crucial enhancement is the Applicability Domain (AD) layer, which computes per-target AD scores, calibrates confidence, returns conformal intervals, gates implausible kinase predictions, and integrates without model retraining.
2.  **Cytotoxicity Prediction Model (Gnosis II / Model 2):** Predicts cancer cell IC50 (R² > 0.7) using *only* real, full-scale datasets (GDSC, DepMap PRISM). Requires strict data cleaning, real genomic features, 80/10/10 scaffold split, tissue-stratified training, and a frozen Gnosis ChemBERTa encoder with a 2-layer MLP.
3.  **Model Registry & Data Management:** A hybrid model registry (MongoDB for metadata, S3 for artifacts/datasets) ensures model organization, versioning, and reproducibility. AWS S3 (us-east-1) serves as the single source of truth for curated datasets and model artifacts synced from Modal training.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the primary focus was on resolving critical frontend display issues and backend data inconsistencies related to the Gnosis I (Ligand Activity Predictor) target selection and categorization.

Specifically, the following issues were addressed:
1.  **Backend Target Endpoint ()**:
    *   **Problem**: The endpoint was initially failing because it attempted to call a non-existent method () on the  object. Additionally, its response format (returning ) did not match the frontend's expectation ().
    *   **Fix**: Modified  to directly use the existing  attribute. The response structure was adjusted to use the  key, as expected by the frontend.
    *   **Refinement**: The backend's target categorization logic within this endpoint was significantly enhanced to correctly classify targets into , , , and , handling overlaps to ensure accurate counts and distribution.

2.  **Missing Training Data Endpoint**:
    *   **Problem**: The frontend component  was making a call to , which did not exist in the backend.
    *   **Fix**: A new endpoint for  was added to  to provide the necessary training data statistics.

3.  **Frontend Prediction Payload Error**:
    *   **Problem**: When Select All targets was chosen in the frontend,  was sending a string  for the  parameter, while the backend's Pydantic model () expected . This caused a validation error on the backend.
    *   **Fix**: Modified  to ensure that when all targets are selected, an actual array of all available target names is sent to the backend.

4.  **Frontend Error Rendering**:
    *   **Problem**: The frontend was crashing () when attempting to render a raw FastAPI Pydantic validation error object directly in JSX.
    *   **Fix**: Improved the error handling in  to properly format the backend error response into a human-readable string before setting the error state, preventing the rendering crash.

5.  **Frontend Target Categorization Display**:
    *   **Problem**: Despite backend fixes, the frontend was initially showing 0 targets in all categories, or incorrect counts, due to a mismatch in how  interpreted the backend's numerical training data counts (expected ).
    *   **Fix**: The  function in  was adjusted to correctly work with the numerical training data counts provided by the backend, ensuring targets are accurately filtered and displayed.

The immediate last action was to initiate a final test (Chat 304) to verify that all these frontend and backend synchronization fixes result in a fully functional and correctly displayed target selection and prediction workflow. The system is currently awaiting the results of this final frontend verification test.
