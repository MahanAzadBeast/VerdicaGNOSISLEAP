<analysis>
The previous AI engineer focused on migrating MolBERT training to Modal and then pivoted to fine-tuning MolBERT/ChemBERTa. My analysis of the trajectory reveals a shift in focus to building a multi-task ChemBERTa model for oncoproteins on Modal. This involved significant data acquisition and preprocessing challenges, initially with a large ChEMBL database download that repeatedly failed due to extraction logic issues (incorrect file names and missing directory creation). This led to a critical pivot to an API-based data extraction approach, which proved successful and efficient for gathering data for 14 oncoproteins. Following the successful data extraction, the user requested setting up W&B integrated training pipelines for both ChemBERTa and Chemprop on Modal. I successfully implemented and debugged the ChemBERTa training pipeline with W&B logging, though detailed per-target metric logging remains an outstanding issue. The Chemprop pipeline setup is in progress, facing ongoing compatibility and import challenges. The current task is to complete the detailed W&B logging for ChemBERTa.

The Veridica AI platform aims to be an AI-driven drug discovery interface, predicting molecular properties (Bioactivity, Toxicity, ADME, Physicochemical, Drug-likeness) from SMILES input. It leverages a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. Core functionality includes pre-trained Chemprop and MolBERT/ChemBERTa models for IC₅₀ prediction, trained on ChEMBL/BindingDB, with future plans for confidence scoring. The UI features a dark-themed, responsive design with Home, Predict Molecule Properties, Result Analysis (with visualizations/export), and About/Contact tabs, including a Spline 3D animation on the homepage. Initial MolBERT training on Modal.com yielded poor R² scores, leading to a focus on fine-tuning pre-trained models. A key recent requirement was offloading heavy AI model computations to Modal.com to prevent local loading. The most comprehensive and recently completed requirement was building and training a multi-task ChemBERTa model on Modal for key oncoproteins (EGFR, HER2, BRAF, MET, MDM2, STAT3, RRM2, β-catenin, MYC, PI3KCA, CDK4, CDK6, ALK, VEGFR2) using ChEMBL data. This included data acquisition, preprocessing, multi-task training setup, and an inference script. The latest user request is to integrate Weights & Biases (W&B) for both ChemBERTa and Chemprop training, logging various metrics and artifacts.

- Fully implement visualizations (bar graphs, scatter plots, heatmaps) and interactive features within the Result Analysis tab, following the initial request.
- Debug and fully implement the fine-tuning of the pre-trained BenevolentAI MolBERT model if the multi-task ChemBERTa approach proves insufficient or if specifically requested again.
- Complete the debugging and robust implementation of the multi-task Chemprop training pipeline.
- Ensure comprehensive per-target R², MSE, MAE, and loss graph logging in W&B for ChemBERTa training.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most immediate and ongoing work involves **enhancing the Weights & Biases (W&B) integration for the ChemBERTa multi-task training pipeline**. While the ChemBERTa training successfully completed and logged general metrics to W&B, the user explicitly requested more granular logging of per-target R², MSE, MAE, and loss graphs for each epoch.

Specifically, the work currently entails modifying the  file to:
1.  Implement a custom callback ( class) for PyTorch Lightning/Hugging Face Trainer.
2.  Within this callback, calculate and log individual metrics (R², MSE, MAE) and loss for each of the 14 oncoprotein targets per epoch.
3.  Ensure these metrics are structured appropriately for W&B to generate time-series graphs (e.g., , ).

This task is crucial for providing the detailed performance insights needed to analyze and compare the model's effectiveness across different cancer targets, fulfilling a core requirement for comprehensive experiment tracking.
