The previous AI engineer diligently worked on the GNOSIS platform, primarily focusing on the Cytotoxicity Prediction Model (Model 2) after stabilizing the Ligand Activity Predictor (Model 1). Initial Model 2 training attempts yielded poor R² scores due to tiny, synthetic datasets and incorrect feature extraction. The engineer extensively debugged data loading, feature dimensions, and model architecture, eventually getting the system to predict using a production model with ChemBERTa embeddings and 25 genomic features. The core challenge became achieving R² > 0.6 using only real data and robust training. A significant pivot occurred when the user proposed leveraging transfer learning from the existing Gnosis I ChemBERTa model. The engineer adopted this strategy, implemented comprehensive data cleaning, scaffold splitting, and a specific multi-stage training schedule. Current efforts are centered on debugging the data loading and tensor dimension issues to successfully train this transfer learning model. A side task involved fixing a Git lock file error.

The Veridica AI platform, GNOSIS, predicts molecular properties and drug sensitivity.

**1. Ligand Activity Predictor (Model 1 / Gnosis I):** This module predicts IC50, EC50, and Ki for oncoproteins/tumor suppressors, aiming for R² > 0.6. Initial issues included only using IC50 and not genuine Ki/EC50. The goal was to enable true Ki/EC50 predictions from comprehensive datasets and update the UI accordingly.

**2. Cytotoxicity Prediction Model (Model 2):** Designed for cancer cell IC50 prediction with genomic context. The primary requirement was to remove normal cells, focus solely on cancer IC50, and achieve R² > 0.6. This model faced persistent training failures due to synthetic data, insufficient scale, and architectural mismatches. The explicit requirement is to use only real, full-scale datasets (GDSC, DepMap PRISM), implement strict data cleaning (pIC50 conversion, R² filters, de-duplication, no synthetic augmentation), and real genomic features (hotspot mutations, CNV, tissue type). The training must use an 80/10/10 scaffold split, be tissue-stratified, and cache splits. The model architecture should be a frozen Gnosis ChemBERTa encoder (768-dim) concatenated with a 2-layer MLP (128-dim) for genomics, followed by LayerNorm, Dropout, FC layers, and pIC50 output. The training schedule involves progressive unfreezing and specific hyperparameters. Target R² ≥ 0.55, with secondary metrics and ablations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a deep debugging session for the **Model 2: Cytotoxicity Prediction Model** training. The user provided a highly detailed systematic debugging checklist following repeated training failures with negative R² values.

The AI engineer's current focus is on implementing these diagnostic steps for the  script, which is designed to perform transfer learning from the existing Gnosis I ChemBERTa model using real GDSC data:

1.  **Label Sanity Check:** The engineer successfully implemented and ran .
    *   **Finding:** The pIC50 labels are correctly transformed and within the ideal range (mean 6.000, median 0.998 µM), with no extreme values. This indicates the label transformation is not the cause of poor R².

2.  **Training Loop Red Flags:** The engineer created  to investigate if batches are being skipped. This is the task that was just initiated as the trajectory ended.

**Previous Context Leading to Current Work:**
-   The previous comprehensive ChemBERTa transfer learning training attempt failed with a , indicating data loading issues on Modal.
-   Prior to that, a  occurred, which led to the discovery that the ChemBERTa encoder was outputting 384 dimensions (not 768) and genomics was 109 dimensions (not 128). These dimension mismatches were fixed in the model architecture.
-   The real GDSC data was confirmed to be available on Modal at  (74,932 records). The training script was updated to use this path.
-   The backend is currently running a production model using 768-dim ChemBERTa embeddings and 25 genomic features, which is functional but has an Unknown R².
-   The engineer had also fixed a critical Git lock file issue (), cleaned up the Git repository, updated , and removed problematic files to enable proper Save to GitHub functionality.

The immediate goal is to systematically debug the  script based on the user's detailed instructions, starting with the training loop checks.
