The previous AI engineer initiated the Veridica AI platform MVP, migrating MolBERT training to Modal.com. Initially facing poor R² scores with custom training, the focus shifted to fine-tuning a pre-trained MolBERT, encountering PyTorch Lightning/HuggingFace compatibility issues. A simplified fine-tuner was created, and the agent began debugging it. The current agent took over, first confirming priorities. Although visualizations were initially requested, the user pivoted back to the MolBERT Modal workflow to ensure performance and proper model storage. This led to significant refactoring and implementation of a Modal-first architecture for both ChemBERTa and Chemprop, focusing on offloading heavy computations to Modal. The most recent directive is to build a multi-task ChemBERTa model for oncoproteins, a complex task involving large dataset handling and GPU training on Modal. This involves detailed data acquisition from ChEMBL, extensive preprocessing, and multi-task model training, currently in the data download and extraction phase.

<product_requirements>
The Veridica AI platform serves as an AI-driven drug discovery interface, predicting molecular properties (Bioactivity, Toxicity, ADME, Physicochemical, Drug-likeness) from SMILES input. It features a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. The core functionality relies on pre-trained Chemprop and MolBERT/ChemBERTa models for IC₅₀ prediction, trained on ChEMBL/BindingDB, with future plans for confidence scoring. The UI includes a dark-themed, responsive design with Home, Predict Molecule Properties, Result Analysis (with visualizations/export), and About/Contact tabs, featuring a Spline 3D animation on the homepage. Initial MolBERT training on Modal.com yielded poor R² scores, leading to a pivot towards fine-tuning pre-trained MolBERT/ChemBERTa models from BenevolentAI or HuggingFace. A key recent requirement is to prevent local loading of heavy AI models, offloading them to Modal.com. The latest, comprehensive requirement is to build and train a multi-task ChemBERTa model on Modal, specifically for key oncoproteins (e.g., EGFR, HER2, BRAF, MET, MDM2, STAT3, RRM2, β-catenin, MYC, PI3KCA, CDK4, CDK6, ALK, VEGFR2) using ChEMBL data, including data acquisition, preprocessing, multi-task training, and an inference script.

- Debug and fully implement the fine-tuning of the pre-trained BenevolentAI MolBERT model if the multi-task ChemBERTa approach proves insufficient or if specifically requested again.
- Continue the ongoing multi-task ChemBERTa model training pipeline on Modal, from data extraction to full model training and inference script generation.

<current_work>
The most immediate and ongoing work is the development and training of a **multi-task ChemBERTa model on Modal for key oncoproteins**. This ambitious project aims to create a single, powerful AI model capable of predicting molecular properties for 14 different cancer-related protein targets.

The current phase involves **data acquisition and preprocessing** using Modal's high-memory CPU instances. Specifically:
1.  **ChEMBL Database Download**: The system successfully downloaded the latest full ChEMBL SQLite dump (ChEMBL v34, 4.9 GB) to a Modal persistent volume (). This step is complete.
2.  **Database Extraction**: The downloaded ChEMBL database is currently being extracted within the Modal environment. This is a prerequisite for extracting the target-specific bioactivity data.

The overarching goal is to prepare a comprehensive dataset ( and ) containing SMILES strings and pIC₅₀ values for all specified oncoproteins, with NaN values where data is unavailable. This dataset will then be used to train the multi-task ChemBERTa model on Modal's A100 GPUs. The model will feature a multi-task regression head, masked MSE loss, and will be split for train/validation/test. An inference script will also be provided.

This work directly follows the decision to move from individual target models to a more scientifically superior and clinically relevant pan-cancer drug discovery engine. It builds upon the previously established Modal-first architecture, ensuring all heavy computations (data processing, model training) are offloaded from the local environment.
