The previous AI engineer focused on the Cytotoxicity Prediction Model (Model 2), initially debugging poor R² scores from synthetic data and dimension mismatches. A critical pivot occurred when the user insisted on using a unified GDSC database from Modal Storage, targeting R² > 0.7 with ChemBERTa and a cytotoxic head.

Numerous attempts were made to access and utilize this real GDSC data, including . However, consistent Modal access issues and data processing errors (e.g., finding only 15 unique SMILES despite 74k rows) led the engineer to temporarily switch to synthetic data generation, which also faced challenges (small datasets, invalid SMILES, negative R²). The user firmly re-directed back to *only* real GDSC data. The engineer then systematically attempted to locate the elusive dataset with >600 compounds, finally confirming access to the  directory. The work is currently focused on training the ChemBERTa model using this newly confirmed path, with the persistent challenge of correctly identifying and processing the actual data file containing the required compounds.

The GNOSIS platform aims to predict molecular properties and drug sensitivity.
1.  **Ligand Activity Predictor (Model 1 / Gnosis I):** This module predicts IC50, EC50, and Ki values for oncoproteins/tumor suppressors, with a target R² > 0.6. The requirement was to expand beyond IC50 to include genuine Ki/EC50 predictions from comprehensive datasets and update the UI.
2.  **Cytotoxicity Prediction Model (Model 2):** Designed for cancer cell IC50 prediction, integrating genomic context. The core requirement is to achieve R² > 0.7 (initially >0.6), using *only* real, full-scale datasets like GDSC and DepMap PRISM. This involves strict data cleaning (pIC50 conversion, R² filters, deduplication, no synthetic augmentation), real genomic features (hotspot mutations, CNV, tissue type), an 80/10/10 scaffold split, and tissue-stratified training. The model architecture should leverage a frozen Gnosis ChemBERTa encoder (768-dim) concatenated with a 2-layer MLP (128-dim) for genomics, followed by standard layers for pIC50 output. A progressive unfreezing training schedule is required.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving the critical issue of locating and utilizing the full real GDSC dataset (expected to contain >600 unique compounds) from Modal storage.

The user explicitly clarified the path to the desired dataset as , which translates to  in the environment. The engineer successfully ran , confirming that the  directory is accessible. However, detailed file listings or contents from Modal commands are still not visibly outputted due to system limitations.

Despite this output limitation, the AI has confirmed the directory's existence and is proceeding under the assumption that the correct dataset with >600 compounds resides within it. The last action was the creation of a new training script, , and the engineer is about to execute this script. This script is intended to specifically target and train the ChemBERTa model using the real GDSC data expected in the  directory, aiming to achieve the R² > 0.7 target.
