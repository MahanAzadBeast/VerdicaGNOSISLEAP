Patients must have metastatic progressive androgen-independent prostate cancer (progressive prostate cancer while continuing to receive hormonal ablation, such as that of an LHRH agonist) documented prior to entry. Progression must be documented by at least one of the following parameters:

1. Two consecutively rising PSA levels, separated by at least one week, with at least one measurement that is 50% above the nadir reached after the last therapeutic maneuver (as long as the measurement is 5 ng/ml or greater); and/or,
2. At least one new metastatic deposit on Tc-99 bone scintigraphy; and/or,

1. Development of new area of malignant disease (measurable or non-measurable);
2. Measurable disease progression by RECIST criteria;
3. At least 4 weeks off of flutamide and 6 weeks off of bicultamide and nilutamide.

Patients who have not undergone surgical castration must continue treatment with an LHRH agonist. If for some reason the LHRH agonist has been discontinued prior to entry on the study, then it should be reinstituted and disease progression must be documented.

Patients must have a life expectancy of more than 3 months.

Patients must have a performance status of 0 to 2 according to the ECOG criteria.

Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy, including surgery.

Hematological eligibility parameters (within 2 weeks before starting therapy):

1. Granulocyte count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm(3)
2. Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm(3)

Biochemical eligibility parameters (within 2 weeks before starting therapy):

2. Hepatic function: Hepatic: Bilirubin less than 1.0 mg/dl, AST and ALT less than 2.5 times upper limit of normal. If the alkaline phosphatase is greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal, it must be fractionated and the hepatic alkaline phosphatase should be less than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.

Hormonal profile for patients with prostate cancer

1\. All patients who have not undergone surgical castration must have a serum testosterone under 50 ng/ml and continue on their GnRh agonist.

Must be able to ingest oral medications to be eligible.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

Patients with brain metastases will not be eligible.

Patients who have received strontium or samarium will not be eligible.

HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy will be excluded because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole, docetaxel or other agents administered during the study.

Patients on theophylline will be excluded.

Patients who are receiving cisapride will be excluded.

Patients who are receiving HMG-CoA inhibitors (lovastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin and cerivastatin)

Patients who are receiving terfenadine, midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam, astemizole, loratadine, rifampin, isoniazid, dofetilide, pimozide, sirolimus or erythromycin will be excluded.

Because gastric acidity is necessary for the dissolution and absorption of ketoconazole, concomitant administration of drugs which decrease gastric acid output or increase gastric pH (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, ranitidine, antimuscarinics, omeprazole, and lansoprazole) may decrease absorption and thus will be prohibited.
